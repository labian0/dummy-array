# Dummy arrays

## General conception and implementation
This project aim to implements _an associative data structure_, structured around three entities, as follows :
- one sub data structure _for indexing_.
- another _to store values_.
- a counter _to keep track of the next index to write onto_.

This data structure must implements three methods :
- **`exists(int value)`** -> return True if the given value is already stored; else False.
- **`add(int value)`** -> if the given values is not already stored, insert it and return True; else return False.
- **`delete(int value)`** -> if the given value is already stored, delete it and return True; else return False
